# snu_beamer_template
This is an unofficial LATEX template for Beamer presentations by and for members of the Seoul National University, South Korea.

The template is private work by members of the Seoul National University. It is not endorsed by the Seoul National University or any of its institutions, institutes, or departments. The template is made available to the public as we think it might be useful for other people. Neither the authors nor the University of Stuttgart provide support for the template going beyond this README.
